# JumpDir CLI Tool

`JumpDir` is a command-line tool written in Go that helps you find directories by name. It performs a depth-first search starting from a specified directory and returns the full path to the target directory.

## Installation

You can install `JumpDir` either by downloading the latest release or by building it from source.

### Option 1: Install from Release

1. **Download the Latest Release**

   Download the `install.sh` script from the [releases page](https://github.com/DNelson35/JumpDir/releases) of this repository.

2. **Make the Installation Script Executable**

   ```sh
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Installation Script**

   ```sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

   The script will download the latest `jumpdir` binary, make it executable, and configure your shell to use the `jd` function.

4. **Restart Your Terminal**

   Restart your terminal or run the following command to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DNelson35/JumpDir.git
   cd JumpDir
   ```

2. **Ensure Go Version 1.22.4 or Later**

   Verify that you have Go version 1.22.4 or later installed:

   ```sh
   go version
   ```

3. **Build the Binary**

   Build the `jumpdir` binary by running:

   ```sh
   go build -o jumpdir-bin/jumpdir
   ```

4. **Set Up the Zsh Shell**

   Add the following function to your `.zshrc` file:

   ```sh
   function jd() {
     local target_dir="$1"
     local start_dir="$2"

     if [[ "$target_dir" == "-help" || "$target_dir" == "--help" ]]; then
       ./jumpdir-bin/jumpdir -help
       return 0
     fi
     if [[ "$start_dir" == "." ]]; then
       local base_path="$(pwd)"
       cd ~
       local sdir="${base_path}"
       local dir=$(./jumpdir-bin/jumpdir $target_dir $sdir)
     else
       cd ~
       local base_path="$(pwd)"
       local sdir="${base_path}${start_dir:+/$start_dir}"
       local dir=$(./jumpdir-bin/jumpdir $target_dir $sdir)
     fi
     cd $dir
   }
   ```

5. **Reload Your Zsh Configuration**

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Usage

The `JumpDir` tool requires two arguments:

- `<target_directory>`: The name of the directory you want to find (required).
- `<starting_point>`: The directory where the search should start (optional). If omitted, the search will start from the home directory. If you pass `.` as the `<starting_point>`, the search will start from your current directory.

### Command Syntax

```sh
jd <target_directory> [<starting_point>]
```

### Example

```sh
jd "targetDirName" /path/to/start
```

This command will search for "targetDirName" starting from `/path/to/start`.

If you want to search starting from your current directory, use:

```sh
jd "targetDirName" .
```

This command will search for "targetDirName" starting from your current location in the file system.

## Zsh Integration

The `install.sh` script configures the `jd` function for you. After running the script or building from source, the function is automatically added to your `.zshrc` file.

### Function Overview

The `jd` function:

- Searches for the specified directory.
- Changes to the found directory if it exists.

## Help and Flags

To display help information for the `JumpDir` tool, use the `-help` or `-h` flags:

```sh
jd -help
```

### Output

```
Usage: go run main.go <target_directory> [<starting_point>]

Arguments:
  <target_directory>    Target directory (required)
  [<starting_point>]    Starting point (optional)

Flags:
  -h, -help   Show help information
```

## Examples

1. **Find a Directory Starting from the Home Directory**

   ```sh
   jd Documents
   ```

   This searches for a directory named `Documents` starting from your home directory.

2. **Find a Directory Starting from a Specific Directory**

   ```sh
   jd myProject workspace
   ```

   This searches for "myProject" starting from `~/workspace`.

3. **Find a Directory Starting from the Current Directory**

   ```sh
   jd myProject .
   ```

   This searches for "myProject" starting from your current location in the file system.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: `target_directory` and `starting_point` are required**: Ensure that both arguments are provided if using the `jd` function.
- **Permission Denied**: Verify that `JumpDir` is executable and properly installed.
- **Function Not Found**: Ensure that `install.sh` has been run or the `.zshrc` file has been updated and reloaded.

## Alpha Release Information

Please note that `JumpDir` is currently in alpha release and is still being tested. Your feedback is highly appreciated as it will help improve the tool. 

### Known Limitations

- **Ignored Files**: The current implementation includes a list of specific files and directories to ignore (e.g., `node_modules`) to speed up the search. This list is located in `search.go`.
- **Permission Issues**: The tool does not yet handle directories that require special permissions to read. This may be addressed in future updates as itâ€™s not considered critical for the tool's intended purpose.
